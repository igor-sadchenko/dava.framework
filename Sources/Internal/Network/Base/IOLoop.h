 Class IOLoop provides event loop which polls for events and schedules handlers (callback) to be run.
 There should be at least one IOLoop instance in network application.
 Run is a core method of IOLoop, and must be called from at most one thread.
 Post is a special method to shedule user specified handler to be run in context of thread where Run
 method is running.
 To finish running IOLoop you should finish all network operations and call PostQuit method
